    <div class="intro"><p>OK, that&#8217;s a bold statement! I guess I should elaborate. Like a lot of teenagers, I worked in a Maccies one summer and I was struck by how awesome the sauce dispenser was.</p></div>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s a funnel attached to a handle with a trigger. Pulling the trigger releases 5 dots of ketchup in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx">quincunx</a> onto the bun. I used this device almost every day and, now that I work in software development, I have decided it&#8217;s the greatest product ever.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_773" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/images/scrummable_mcdonalds-sauce-gun.jpg" style="aspect-ratio: 480/320"><p id="caption-attachment-773" class="wp-caption-text">The greatest product ever!</p></div></p>
<p>The amount of effort and money that has gone into developing this device is surely astounding. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/opinion/at-mcdonalds-fat-profits-but-lean-wages.html">McDonald&#8217;s are a decidedly profit-driven enterprise</a>. The sauce gun dispenses <em>exactly</em> the right amount of condiment &#8211; enough to finely coat the meat when the bread is put on top but not cost the company unnecessary overheads.</p>
<p>What makes this relevant to software development is that the sauce dispenser does what every good product should do &#8211; <strong>one thing&hellip;and one thing really well</strong>.</p>
<h2>Everything to everyone</h2>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t try to be everything to everyone &#8211; the ones that do always seem to come across as novelty items. To use an example from the real world, I&#8217;m not convinced that a <a href="https://www.clifford-james.co.uk/buy.cfm/kitchen-gadgets/cooks-professional-coffee-n-toast-maker/68/yes/151191">coffee maker and toaster in one</a> would make coffee and toast better that a coffee-machine <em>and</em> a toaster as separate appliances.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_845" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/images/scrummable_LMF-SPORKS-MULTI-5-800x746.jpg" style="aspect-ratio: 800/746"><p id="caption-attachment-845" class="wp-caption-text">Yes, that&#8217;s a knispork!</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, the best apps only do one thing and they do it really well. 500px for photo sharing, DropBox for storing files in the cloud, Google Keep for taking notes. I love Keep. Sure there&#8217;s Evernote and Quip and [insert any other &#8220;note-taking&#8221; app here], but Keep is so ridiculously simple it&#8217;s a dream to use.</p>
<p>Too many products suffer from &#8220;feature bloat&#8221; where stakeholders keep adding new shiny features into a product. Of course, additional functionality isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing but these things usually come at a cost. How many times have you had to sideline tech debt to implement a new feature? How often do you see &#8220;delighters&#8221; put into an app instead of fixing a glaring bug?</p>
<p>It is the equivalent of the pub that puts a pool table in but never cleans the floor &#8211; and we&#8217;ve all been there!</p>
<p><img src="/images/scrummable_pool-table.jpg" style="aspect-ratio: 533/400"></p>
<h2>Alienating your core audience</h2>
<p>One reason additional features can be the worst thing for your product is alienating your core audience.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/">Atlassian bought Trello</a>, reportedly to serve a chunk of their core demographic that was turning away from Jira.</p>
<p>Jira started life as a bug-tracker. A simple piece of software for tracking tickets, now it&#8217;s one of the most <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/software/best-project-management-71515632">popular project management tools</a> in the world used by big names such as Twitter, Skype, and NASA as well as <a href="https://discovery.hgdata.com/product/atlassian-jira">over 50,000 more</a>.</p>
<p>In <em>The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma</em>, Clayton Christensen explains that companies are in danger of racing ahead for greater, more lucrative markets, and leave a void behind them to be exploited. This is what happened to Jira; a plucky young upstart rode their coat-tails picking up disgruntled users like gulls following a fishing trawler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  [Trello offers] a fun new way for teams to organize the often messy range of information that feeds into great teamwork<br>
  <cite><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-plus-trello">Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian CEO</a></cite>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, as Atlassian&#8217;s flagship product got more complex, those users who initially started using it for its simplicity began to jump ship.</p>
<h2>This time next year, Rodney&hellip;</h2>
<p>Of course, not all products that succeed remain doing their initial function. Amazon began life just selling textbooks to students, Google was only a search engine before they moved into conquering every facet of the internet.</p>
<p>But imagine the chaos of Jeff Bezos&#8217; garage if Amazon had started by selling the range of products they do today.</p>
<p>Where Amazon succeeded here was with their mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Our vision is to be earth&#8217;s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.<br>
  <cite>Amazon&#8217;s Mission Statement</cite>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The promise to do one thing perfectly and not alienate users is right there in the statement.</p>
<p>By ensuring that every potential feature <em>must</em> align with the mission statement, we are in a stronger position to push back on <strong>every single</strong> feature under consideration.</p>
<p>By justifying features, we can make sure they are added for the right reasons and we can reduce feature bloat in our products.</p>
<p>When David Hasselhoff&#8217;s Michael Knight first sees KITT&#8217;s dashboard in <em>Knight Rider</em> he remarks that it reminds him of Darth Vader&#8217;s bathroom. Faced with so many buttons and levers and switches, it becomes difficult to drive a car &#8211; the fundamental use-case. Admittedly, KITT was self-driving but, I promise, my point still stands!</p>
<p>And so, we&#8217;re back to sauce dispensers.</p>
<p>If the ketchup dispenser also deposited pickles and mustard, we&#8217;d have a burger quicker but that many moving parts would render it a nightmare to maintain. You wouldn&#8217;t be able to put pickles on anything if the ketchup ran out. Cleaning it every night would be horrendous!</p>
<p>So the humble sauce dispenser dispenses sauce. Perfectly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  McDonald&#8217;s brand mission is to be our customers&#8217; favorite place and way to eat and drink&hellip; We are committed to continuously improving our operations and enhancing our customers&#8217; experience.<br>
  <cite>McDonald&#8217;s Mission Statement</cite>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the promise to do one thing perfectly while not alienating users is right there in the statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do one thing perfectly</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t alienate users</li>
<li>Repeat ad infinitum</li>
</ul>
<p>Does a special device that provides a regimented amount of ketchup align with the corporate mission statement? Of <em>sauce</em> it does!</p>
