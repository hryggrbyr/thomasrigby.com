    <p><strong>We need to expand our vocabulary.</strong></p>
<p>Different devices have different capabilities, using mobile to describe both narrow screens and touch screens is confusing and leads to assumptions that come back to bite us.</p>
<p>If I dock my browser to half of my screen (which I do a lot) it's the same width as a portrait iPad but it doesn't have the same capability - I have hover states, for example.</p>
<p>Conversely, an iPad Pro is bigger than my laptop but has a touch screen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrow screens</strong> require adjusting layout</li>
<li><strong>Touch capability</strong> requires adjusting functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't require any extra designs, we need to think about whether this design works.</p>
<p>And, of course, use our new vocabulary to accurately maintain our products.</p>
<h2>I'll give you an exampleâ€¦</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on a project - the frontend is responsive and the layout stacks according to the screen dimensions. On the homepage there is a carousel of cards where additional copy is displayed on hover.</p>
<video style="width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 2444/1604;" width="244" height="160" poster="/images/show-hide-hover-demo.gif" controls="">
  <source src="/images/show-hide-hover-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>I was asked to make the additional copy <q>always visible on mobile</q>.</p>
<p>In this case, &quot;mobile&quot; is not correct. If I was to only target &quot;narrow screens&quot;, the functionality is still broken on large touchscreens because the issue with this hidden copy is &quot;hoverability&quot;, not screen size.</p>
<p>Showing/hiding the copy based on whether the screen is wider or narrower than 768px wouldn't solve the problem!</p>
<p>It's almost always a matter of education. A client is going to notice a bug on her iPhone and relay it as &quot;on mobile&quot;. And that's absolutely fine; it's not her job to be aware of all of the nuance - it's ours.</p>
<p>The trick here is not to assume that <em>her</em> definitition of &quot;mobile&quot; is identical to <em>your</em> definition of &quot;mobile&quot; and plough ahead making changes. Consider what is causing the issue, maybe even ask whether it's caused by a narrow screen, touch or lack thereof.</p>
<p>If you work with a client for any length of time, they'll cotton on and start to use the vocabulary.</p>
<p>Everyone speaking the same language leads to less confusion, less faux pas, less re-fixing the same bug because we assumed wrong.</p>
