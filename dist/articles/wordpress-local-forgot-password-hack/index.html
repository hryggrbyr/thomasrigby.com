    <p>I have lost count of the number of times I've forgotten the password to the local or development CMS.</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to click the <em>Forgot Password</em> link but, obviously, there's no way to trigger that email from the local system.</p>
<p>I've spent too long hunting through articles on how to recover the forgotten password. The quickest and easiest solution that I've found is to change the password manually in the database.</p>
<h2>How do we do that then?</h2>
<p>WordPress stores passwords in the <code>wp_users</code> table. The prefix may be different if you have elected to change that in the <code>wp-config.php</code> file. It's good practice to do that for security.</p>
<p>When you look at the table, it'll look a little like thisâ€¦</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>user_login</th>
<th>user_pass</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td>$P$BHpcLw/aWsTPmeDprzXwOEl45bJm9A3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>WordPress stores your password as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hashed string</a>. This prevents anyone with access to the database seeing confidential information in plain text.</p>
<p>WordPress salts the password using <a href="https://www.openwall.com/phpass/">PHPass</a> (as you can see from the <code>$P$</code> at the start of the example password). This hack will still work though as, even if your password has been salted, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/resetting-your-password/">you can still replace the password with an MD5 hash, and WordPress will let you log in</a>.</p>
<p>If this <em>wasn't</em> obfuscated like this, we'd be able to copy our password and paste it into the login formâ€¦but we can't - and for good reason!</p>
<p>So, to fix our little problem, we need to replace the existing hashed password with a new hashed password - we can't overwrite the MD5 hash with plain text because that won't work.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deerawan.vscode-hasher">Hasher</a> installed as a plugin in VS Code. If you don't use VS Code or don't want to use this extension, <a href="https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/">MD5 Hash Generator Online</a> works pretty well.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you don't create your &quot;forever password&quot; using these hash generators though. Overwrite the existing password with something easy to remember and <strong>very, very temporary</strong> - a favourite of mine is <code>Pa55word!</code> â€”</p>
<pre class="language-bash " style="counter-reset: linenumber 0"><code class="language-bash">267057150e34eca5c6af39ec9b30864e
</code></pre>
<p>Once the password has been changed, you can log in with your new password <strong>and immediately change it to something more secure</strong>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
