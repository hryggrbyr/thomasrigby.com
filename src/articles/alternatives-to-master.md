In an effort to remove unnecessary references to slavery and replace them with more inclusive terms, many companies are opting to replace the term `master` as their main git branch name.

GitHub [opted for _Main_](https://github.com/github/renaming) but here are a few other options to consider.

## First
- **Base**
- **Main**
- **Primary**
- **Source**

## Cloning

The term for the person from whom a clone is, well, cloned in various science fiction novels and shows.

- **Original** (_[Orphan Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/)_)
- **Prime** (_[Mirror Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Dance)_)
- **Template** (_[Saturn's Children](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2278387.Saturn_s_Children)_)

## Genealogy
- **Progenitor**: The [progenitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor) is the – sometimes legendary – founder of a family, line of descent, clan or tribe, noble house or an ethnic group.

## Nature

"Cloning" is a horticultural term deriving from the Greek word for _twig_.

- **Root**
- **Radix** (Latin for "Root")
- **Trunk** (Neatly relates to "branches" in development. Also used in _[SVN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)_)
