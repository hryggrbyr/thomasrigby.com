I have a fairly decent laptop provided by my employer and I'm lucky enough to have a strong, reliable internet connection. Not everyone does. I'll say that again for the Bro's at the back: 

> Not all of your users will have a top-spec device and good wifi like you do.

In the past I've been guilty of assuming that everyone has a comparable experience to myself. 

**This leads to Bad Habits‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.**

## How to be better

Optimise for performance over appearance. Basically, don't make someone download 5Gb of images and 500Mb of JavaScript just to read your Terms & Conditions page.

Test on spotty wifi. Try using the site on a train or in a coffee shop or using the City's free wifi (if you have it where you are). This is how your user will experience your site - not via 100Gb Ethernet cables.

Test on budget devices - find a few common mid-priced devices (you could probably get them from [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=iphone+7&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=iphone+7)) and test on those instead.

If you're feeling extra spicy - make sure at least one of those devices has a cracked screen for a truly authentic browsing experience üòú
