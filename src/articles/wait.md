Why the rush&hellip;?!

Whether you're faking an API response, introducing deliberate cognitive drain, or simply want to slow things down this utility function has got you, baby! ðŸ˜Ž

```js
const delay = ms => new Promise(rv => setTimeout(rv, ms))
```

## Cool! How do I use it?

```js
delay(500).then(() => console.log(`hello world`))
```

Nice! Does it work with `async/await`?

Heck, yes, it does!

```js
const functionName = async () => {

  doFirstThing()

  await delay(500)

  doNextThing()
}
```
