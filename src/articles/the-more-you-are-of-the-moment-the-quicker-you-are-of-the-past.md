<h3>Bleeding-edge tech is cool!</h3>
<p>As a self-confessed tech nerd, I get excited at the newest, shiniest development in… well, development. However inappropriate I really, really want to incorporate it into whatever project I’m currently working on. Refactoring an entire site to be Apple Watch compatible, scouring the web for the Next-Big-Thing in web design &#8211; parallax, salmon pink, enormous &lt;video&gt; backgrounds, working out if this blog is usable with Google Glass (probably not!). Seriously, I’ve tried to shoehorn <em>all</em> of these things into a single website. The thing is &#8211; sure, that site looks <strong>amazeballs</strong>… for about a week. Fingers crossed, it’ll be cool long enough for <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a> to notice it but, ask yourself, honestly &#8211; hand-on-heart &#8211; does your client <em>need</em> all of this bumf?</p>
<p>It all ties back to <a href="http://www.scrummable.com/making-like-a-mob-boss-knowing-your-problem-and-how-to-fix-it-2/">the end goal of the site</a>. It may be that the client wants a rapidly-dating, awwward-winning website and, hopefully, they’ll come back to you next month for the replacement because the trendiest color has changed and they want to “re-brand”. More often than not, though, a client wants to achieve something grander than that. Awards for being awesome are lovely but they’re not the be-all and end-all of your brand &#8211; just ask <a href="https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/s/6-reasons-leonardo-dicaprio-has-never-won-an-oscar-091733412.html">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>!</p>

<h3>Mind your fingers on the cutting edge</h3>
<p>As with the bread-and-butter elements of design; typography, imagery, and layout, bleeding-edge techniques should be used when relevant and <strong>at no other time</strong>. You wouldn’t consider using this week’s <em>font-du-jour</em> without justification, so why <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/web-design-trend-2013/">fixed headers</a></span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="http://www.gibedigital.com/blog/2013/september/02/is-parallax-scrolling-web-design-dead/">parallax backgrounds</a></span> <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2900889/web-design-trend-predictions-for-2016-2017.html">Material Design</a>…?</p>
