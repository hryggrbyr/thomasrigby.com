To prevent ugly errors in your console when you loop through an array, React likes you to use a _unique key_ for each child element.

We usually use the loop index. This is not advised for several reasons<sup>1, 2</sup>.

Instead try thisâ€¦

`Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)`

This will give you a (fairly) random 9-character alphanumerical string.

``` jsx
<ul>
    { items.map(x => <li key={ Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9) }>{x}</li> }
</ul>
```

This is useful for "throwaway" keys. If you're going to be referencing the keys in any way, you need to use a unique property (like an `ID` or `slug`).
